== Versioning

=== Version numbers

version numbers X.Y.Z.label should be understood like this:

* X: Major version, a major version adds new features and breaks compatibility with previous major and minor versions.
* Y: Minor version, a minor version adds new features and does not break compatibility with previous minor versions for
the same major version.
* Z: Patch, a patch version only contains bug fixes of current minor version
* label: pre-release or build metadata:
** SNAPSHOT: a version whose development is in progress, nightly builds only deliver SNAPSHOT versions
** RELEASE: a version whose development is finished

=== Releasing Version

To release a version we use some Travis dedicated jobs. Before releasing a version, you need to prepare the release.

Considering a version X.X.X.SNAPSHOT.

*In operatorfabric-core:*

* replace X.X.X.SNAPHOT with X.X.X.RELEASE
* commit with the model message:
```
[RELEASE] X.X.X.RELEASE (ci_docker,ci_latest,ci_documentation)

```
* tag the commit with the version

```
git tag X.X.X.RELEASE
```

* push both the commit and the tag

The commit comment leverages three keywords to trigger the delivery of documentation and docker images:

* ci_docker: triggers the build and upload of versioned docker images to dockerhub
* ci_latest: associate the latest alias to the current versioned docker images
* ci_documentation: triggers the build and upload of the current documentation

*In operatorfabric documentation project _data/versions.yml file*:

change:

```
- name: X.X.X
  fullname: X.X.X.SNAPSHOT
  badges:
  - name: SNAPSHOT
    style: badge-snapshot
```

to:

```
- name: X.X.X
  fullname: X.X.X.RELEASE
  badges:
  - name: RELEASE
    style: badge-release
  - name: CURRENT
    style: badge-current
```

*In Jira*

* Set all concerned tickets (US, BUG, FR) and set fix version to X.X.X.RELEASE
* In the version screen release X.X.X.RELEASE version;
=== Preparing next version

To prepare a next version you simply need to increment the version after a release (see <<Version numbers>>).

*In operatorfabric-core*

* Replace all occurrences of X.X.X.RELEASE by Y.Y.Y.SNAPHOT.
* commit changes for the following message:

```
[PREPARE] next version: Y.Y.Y.SNAPSHOT
```

*In operatorfabric documentation project _data/versions.yml file*:

Add the Y.Y.Y.SNAPHOT version

```
- name: Y.Y.Y
  fullname: Y.Y.Y.SNAPSHOT
  badges:
  - name: SNAPSHOT
    style: badge-snapshot
```

*In Jira*

* In the version screen create a  Y.Y.Y..RELEASE version;
