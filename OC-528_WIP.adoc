= OC-528 Implicit Flow using Angular-OAuth2-oidc

WARNING: It's a W.I.P

== Test Configuration

For the key `operatorfabric.security.oauth2.flow.mode` in `${OF_HOME}/services/infra/config/build/docker-volume/dev-configuration/web-ui.yml` file replace the value `CODE` with `IMPLICIT`.

In the keycloak manager need to add as authorized redirect url the following url : `http://localhost:4200/*` and enable the `IMPLICIT FLOW` for `operatorfabric` client.


== TODO

* enable server configuration in the `web-ui.yml`. For the moment, the url is a localhost instance of keycloak, i.e. `localhost:89` and the realm is `dev`.
* put more business logic in `AuthenticationModeFlowHandler`;
* unit tests to be corrected or implemented for new classes;


== Known Issues

* some times it's needed to click several times on the login button in order to connect to keycloak;
* the refresh token process is broken
